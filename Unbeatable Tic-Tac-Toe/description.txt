Unbeatable tic tac toe game developed using the Minimax Algorithm.
The algorithm allows AI to calculate the best possible move depending on the state of the board or given the list of available places to play.
The algorithm allows AI to either always win or in the worst-case have the game result in a tie. Thereby not allowing the human player to win.
